`foraging_model.m`

Simulation of swim trajectories based on correlated and "random" turning statistics (Related to [Figure 6](https://elife-publishing-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/12741/elife-12741-fig6-v2.jpg))

Simulated trajectories were used to assess the effieincy of foraging for virtual resources. Correlated trajectories, whose average     behavior matched that of real zebrafish during exploration, beat "random" trajectories (after normalizing for diffusion). 

`spontaneous-turning.ipynb`

And an example analysis in the form of a Jupyter notebook. The notebook shows how to load data and generate a map for one of the data sets shown in [Figure 2](https://elife-publishing-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/12741/elife-12741-fig2-v2.jpg).
